M13ContextMenu
============

M13ContextMenu is a Pintrest style context menu for iOS. Designed to work with UICollectionViews, it is easily added to any UICollectionView to add a context menu for each cell. It can also be added to any other UIView. The items are  customizable, so it is very easy to style the context menu for your application.

Features:
----------

* Setup is very simple. Initalize the menu with a set of menu items.

* The menu items have a base class, which can be subclassed to your needs. The base class has methods that can be overriden to allow custom display changes when the item is selected/unselected.

Usage:
-------
There are two examples included in the example project. One adding the menu to a basic UIView. The other adding it to a UICollectionView, and showing how to retreive what cell the menu was called on. Check the examples for the setup information.
